# HANDOFF — BICS Restart

## Goal

BICS — Financial Energy System заново начинается как учебный и портфолио-проект на HTML, CSS и JavaScript.

Первый MVP — это не полноценный финансовый инструмент, а понятное первое объяснение модели BICS.

## Current Project State

Project folder:

`d:\Codex\BICS-restart`

Files:
- `README.md` — filled
- `AGENTS.md` — filled
- `HANDOFF.md` — being updated now
- `index.html` — filled
- `styles.css` — filled
- `script.js` — empty

Old project folder `d:\Codex\BICS` was not changed.

## Current Progress

Already done:
- created clean project folder `BICS-restart`;
- created six starter files;
- filled `README.md` with the basic idea of BICS;
- filled `AGENTS.md` with project rules and Teaching Mode;
- completed grill-me discussion for the first MVP;
- created the first `index.html` structure by hand with the user;
- added `header`, summary section, BICS categories section, and example transactions section;
- the user practiced HTML heading hierarchy: `h1 → h2 → h3`;
- the user cleaned up spacing to make the HTML easier to read;
- initial CSS started;
- body styles added;
- page width limited with `max-width`;
- sections styled as simple readable cards;
- CSS remains beginner-friendly;
- learned how HTML classes work;
- added `categories-section` to the BICS categories section;
- added `category-card` to all four category blocks;
- replaced broad CSS selectors with more precise class-based selectors for category cards;
- added `transactions-section` to the example transactions section;
- replaced broad list selectors with more precise transaction-section selectors;
- the user practiced choosing selectors by element role and context;
- added `summary-section` to the first content section;
- the current main sections now have clear role-based class names:
  - `summary-section`
  - `categories-section`
  - `transactions-section`
- class names describe the role of each block, not its visual style;
- the HTML structure became cleaner and easier to understand;
- set explicit font sizes for `h1`, `h2`, and `h3`;
- the user practiced understanding typographic hierarchy;
- the header subtitle became visually quieter with smaller text and softer color.

## Agreed First MVP

The first MVP is not a full finance tool.

It is a clear one-page explanation of the BICS model.

Agreed decisions:
- the main hero of the screen is the BICS system itself, not numbers;
- the page uses one column;
- page order: `header → summary → 4 categories → example transactions`;
- interface language: Russian;
- category names stay in English:
  - Basic
  - Invest
  - Chaos
  - Signal
- categories must appear in order: `B → I → C → S`;
- summary briefly explains the core idea;
- summary includes the key example: the same purchase can belong to different categories depending on the reason;
- each category has a simple explanation and one example;
- transactions include one example per category;
- transaction examples do not include amounts;
- each transaction shows the reason and category;
- product tone is calm and non-judgmental;
- Chaos and Signal must not be presented as “bad”.

## What Is Not Included Yet

The first MVP does not include:
- percentages;
- goals;
- recurring expenses;
- add transaction button;
- transaction form;
- calculations;
- complex visual design.

## Success Criteria

A new person should understand within one minute:
- what BICS is;
- how the four categories differ;
- why the reason behind a purchase matters.

## Important Decisions

- Start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.
- No React.
- No TypeScript.
- No backend.
- No database.
- No libraries.
- The user is a beginner in programming.
- Codex must work as a teacher and mentor.
- The user wants to build BICS himself.
- Codex must not generate the whole project instead of the user.
- Codex should guide the user using the pattern:
  `explain → small assignment → user attempt → review → next step`.
- Codex should give hints before full solutions.
- Complete code should be provided only if the user explicitly asks or if a correction cannot be explained otherwise.
- Development order: structure first, then style, then logic.

## What Must Not Be Changed

- Do not modify the old folder `d:\Codex\BICS` without explicit permission.
- Do not rename the BICS categories:
  - Basic
  - Invest
  - Chaos
  - Signal
- Do not make Chaos or Signal sound morally bad.
- Do not add amounts to first MVP transaction examples.
- Do not add calculations, percentages, forms, buttons, goals, or recurring expenses yet.
- Do not introduce React, TypeScript, backend, database, or libraries without explanation and permission.
- Do not write large chunks of code without need.
- Do not rewrite the whole project without request.

## Current Problems

- no technical problems yet;
- HTML and beginner-friendly CSS are in progress;
- no JavaScript yet.

## Open Questions

- What exact text should be used in the first `index.html`?
- What four example transactions should be shown?
- What should the first simple visual style look like?

## Next Steps

1. Review the current typography after adjusting heading sizes.
2. Continue with one small visual CSS improvement.
3. Keep visual hierarchy clear and simple.

## Recommended Next Prompt

Create only the first minimal `index.html` structure for BICS.

Use the rules from `AGENTS.md` and `HANDOFF.md`.

Requirements:
- Russian interface language
- header
- summary
- four BICS categories in order: Basic, Invest, Chaos, Signal
- example transactions: one per category
- no amounts
- show reason and category for each transaction
- no CSS
- no JavaScript
- no buttons
- no forms
- no calculations
- no extra features

Work as a teacher and explain the HTML structure simply.
