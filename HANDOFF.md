# HANDOFF — BICS Restart

## Goal

BICS — Financial Energy System is being rebuilt as a beginner-friendly portfolio project using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The first MVP is a clear one-page explanation of the BICS model, not a full finance tool yet.

## Current Project State

Project folder: `d:\Codex\BICS-restart`

Files:
- `README.md` — filled
- `AGENTS.md` — filled
- `HANDOFF.md` — updated for session handoff
- `index.html` — filled

Old project folder `d:\Codex\BICS` was not changed.
GitHub is synchronized with `origin/main`.

## Important Decisions

- The user builds BICS himself; Codex acts as teacher, mentor, and reviewer.
- Workflow: `explain → small assignment → user attempt → review → next step`.
- Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for now.
- No React, TypeScript, backend, database, or libraries without explanation and permission.
- Keep category names unchanged: Basic, Invest, Chaos, Signal.
- Keep tone calm and non-judgmental.
- Build order: structure first, then style, then logic.

## Current Status

- GitHub: synchronized with `origin/main`.
- Working tree: clean at the last checkpoint.
- JavaScript: not started yet.
- No technical blockers currently known.

## Next Small Step

Review the current typography and continue with one small visual CSS improvement while keeping the page simple.

## Recommended Next Prompt

`Continue BICS from HANDOFF.md. Review the current typography in styles.css, explain the next smallest useful CSS improvement, and give me one small assignment. Do not start JavaScript yet.`
